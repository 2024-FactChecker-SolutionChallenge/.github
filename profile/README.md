###‚ùóÔ∏è¬†Introduction

Fake news has become a global social problem, spreading misinformation and causing harm. It's fueled by AI-generated content and deep-fake technology, disrupting the information ecosystem. This issue is particularly evident during critical events like the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and US elections.
In response, the US media plans to combat misinformation by disseminating fake videos of Russia attacking its own country during the Ukraine conflict. This tactic aims to expose the invasion's reality. However, fake news exacerbates confusion and anxiety, contributing to international conflict.
The spread of fake news is also alarming domestically, especially among students whose literacy suffers due to digital media exposure. Korean students exhibit low proficiency in identifying digital information authenticity, the lowest among OECD countries. Primary school teachers attribute this to students' reliance on video platforms like YouTube and deficient reading skills.
To address this, several solutions have been proposed:
1. Providing Reliable Information: AI can evaluate article reliability based on users' interests, offering protection against biased information and fake news.
2. YouTube Fact Check: Users can input YouTube video URLs to assess their credibility using AI-based systems. This helps users navigate the platform's vast content and find trustworthy sources.
3. Improving Grammar and Vocabulary: Enhancing language skills is crucial for understanding information accurately. Introducing word quizzes and incentivizing learning through gamification and rewards can help users improve literacy.
By implementing these measures, users can better discern accurate information, fostering a healthier society.

### ‚úî UN SDGs Goals & Target
We are now living in an infodemic era where false information and rumors spread rapidly through IT devices and the media, causing social, political and other crises.Concerns about the impact of fake news and information bias on society are now becoming a global problem. In particular, the spread of digital media is reducing students' literacy and vocabulary, and increasing the risk of exposure to fake news. The problem of fake news is recognised as an important social problem, both internationally and nationally, and to address it requires the dissemination of accurate information and efforts to verify whether the articles are true or not. We worked hard to solve this. We pursue Peace & Justice & Strong Institutions to help build a healthy society by providing Quality Education to enhance the ability to acquire and discern the right information.
Fake news is prominent on digital platforms, which have become one of the main routes of news consumption. While social media and search engines provide users with a variety of information, it is difficult to determine the authenticity of this information. To address these problems, global IT companies such as Google and Facebook are focusing their efforts on highlighting fact-check articles, identifying and removing fake news. Google highlights fact-checked articles in search results, and Facebook has a policy to restrict the distribution of fake news on social media platforms.
These efforts ultimately play an important role in protecting democracy and social order and inining a healthy society. Improving users' ability to acquire and discern the right information will help to maintain the foundations of a healthy democracy. To this end, it is necessary to pursue Peace & Justice & Strong Institutions among the UN Sustainable Development Goals to build a peaceful and just society.
